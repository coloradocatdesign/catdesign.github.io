    <h2> About Me and My Start </h2>
    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>I was raised as the youngest of four kids, born in 2000. As all my siblings were born in the 90's I grew up mainly in a milenial house hold. Even if it is late milenial its still techincallt there. My siblings have always picked on me like most families, but my oldest sibiling taught me art and math in the begining. While all my family have been artistic my mom and my oldest sibling have shown me the most I need to to. They have really helped me becaome the person I am. My closest in age sibling is actually one of my best friend and we make a lot of stupid jokes.</p>
